# Story of a Mage

This is the story of a mage headed to market.

## Chapter 1 – A thorny situation

A mage is walking to the market. The road was clear yesterday. He could've sworn this thorny patch of weeds wasn't here before. The mage looked down at his sandals. "I'll be fine," he reassured himself. So he stepped gently across the weeds, as the thorns snagged at his ankles.

*The mage, originally at 20 health, took minor damage with each step he took. He took 2 damage, then 1, then 4 (a thorn got under his toenail), then 1. For each step he takes, how much damage does he take and how much health does he have left? How much health does he have left once he reaches the other end of the bramble patch?*

## Chapter 2 – Fibonacci frailty

The mage's toenail is throbbing from where the bramble patch really got him good. As he nears the end of his thorny journey, the mage notices the beautifully coiled vines beside the path. Those vines, coiled in the Golden Ratio, could only mean one thing This was Fibonacci Weed! The mage could already feel it setting in, that terrible condition known as Fibonacci Frailty!

Excerpt from a book, from the mage's diverse library:

> Fibonacci Frailty: Not so bad, at first. On the first step, the victim feels no loss of vigor. But the second step saps one (1) stamina. Every step thereafter saps as much stamina as the previous two steps combined. On the third step, one (1) stamina is lost. The fourth steals two (2). Then 3, 5, and 8.

*The mage sees a bench in the market square. It is eleven steps away. Will he make it? For each step he takes, how much stamina does he lose and how much stamina does he have left? Does he reach the bench?*

## Chapter 3 – The traveling mage problem

The mage collapses on the bench, exhausted. He utters an encantation, refilling his stamina. He knows that Fibonacci Frailty starts from scratch again every time you rest up. He must get to a potion shop in as few steps as possible, in order to purchase an antidote, and a health potion, for that matter. He looks over at the bulletin board in the market square.

*The mage looks at `ye_olde_store_directory.yaml`, searching for the closest potions shop. Which shop should he go to? And will he make it there before collapsing from exhaustion?*

## Chapter 4 – Good for what ails you
