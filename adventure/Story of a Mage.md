# Story of a Mage

This is the story of a mage headed to market.

## Chapter 1 – A thorny situation

A mage is walking to the market. The road was clear yesterday. He could've sworn this thorny patch of weeds wasn't here before. The mage looked down at his sandals. "I'll be fine," he reassured himself. So he stepped gently across the weeds, as the thorns snagged at his ankles.

*The mage, originally at 20 health, takes minor damage with each step. He takes 2 damage, then 1, then 4 (a thorn got under his toenail), then 1. For each step he takes, how much damage does he take and how much health does he have left? How much health does he have left once he reaches the other end of the bramble patch?*

## Chapter 2 – Fibonacci frailty

The mage's toenail is throbbing from where the bramble patch really got him good. As he nears the end of his thorny journey, the mage notices the beautifully coiled vines beside the path. Those vines, coiled so perfectly in the Golden Ratio, could only mean one thing This was Fibonacci Weed! The mage could already feel it setting in, that terrible condition known as Fibonacci Frailty!

Excerpt from *Ancient Ailments*, from the mage's library:

> Fibonacci Frailty: Not so bad, at first. On the first step, the victim feels no loss of vigor. But the second step saps one (1) stamina. Every step thereafter saps as much stamina as the previous two steps combined. On the third step, one (1) stamina is lost. The fourth steals two (2). Then 3, 5, and 8.

*The mage sees a bench in the market square. It is eleven steps away. Will he make it? For each step he takes, how much stamina does he lose and how much stamina does he have left? Does he reach the bench?*

## Chapter 3 – The traveling mage problem

The mage collapses on the bench, exhausted. He utters an encantation, refilling his stamina. But it's only a temporary solution, he needs an antidote. He knows that Fibonacci Frailty will begin anew every time he rests up. He must get to a potion shop in as few steps as possible. He looks over at the bulletin board in the market square.

*The mage looks at `ye_olde_store_directory.yaml`, searching for the closest potion shop. Which shop should he go to? And will he make it there before collapsing from exhaustion?*

## Chapter 4 – Good for what ails you

The mage stumbles into the shop and doubles over in order to catch his breath. "Long time no see, Percy," the mage said between raspy breaths, "How's the old ball and chain treating you?" Percy gestured to his right ankle with a nod, "Well I'm still here, aren't I?" Long ago, a jilted ex-lover had cursed Percival to be chained to an unmoving ball in the snow. Percy, ever the enterprising man, had paid the villagers to build his potions shop around him.

"Percy, I am just wiped out. Got a touch of the Fib. You got an antidote?" Percival nodded, "It'll be fifty silver, and you'll have to fetch it yourself. It's on the back wall, out of my reach."

*The mage sighed. It wasn't about the money. He had plenty in his purse, two (2) gold (worth 100 silver each), and 40 silver. But the three (3) steps between him and the antidote seemed like a chasm. The Fib doesn't reset unless you sit on a bench, and his stamina spell was still on cooldown. All he had in his pouch was half a chocolate bar, worth twelve (12) stamina. He would have to get as close to the antidote as possible, then use a Ranged Reach spell to grab the potion (two or higher on a D6). Then he could drink the potion and finally be rid of this pestilence.*
